Read the job description carefully and highlight the skills and experience that are most relevant.\n*   **Use Keywords:**  Incorporate keywords from the job description throughout your resume, especially in the Skills and Experience sections.  Many companies use Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) to screen resumes, and these systems often rely on keywords to identify qualified candidates.\n*   **Keep it Concise:**  Aim for a one-page resume if you have less than 10 years of experience.  If you have more than 10 years of experience, a two-page resume is acceptable.\n*   **Use a Professional Font:**  Choose a clean and easy-to-read font such as Arial, Calibri, Times New Roman, or Helvetica.  Use a font size of 10-12 points.\n*   **Use Consistent Formatting:**  Maintain consistent formatting throughout your resume, including font size, spacing, and bullet point style.\n*   **Proofread Carefully:**  Proofread your resume carefully for any typos, grammatical errors, or formatting inconsistencies.  Have someone else review it as well.\n*   **Save as a PDF:**  Save your resume as a PDF file to ensure that the formatting is preserved when you submit it online.\n*   **Action Verbs:**  Use strong action verbs to describe your accomplishments.  Avoid passive voice.  Here are some examples:\n    *   **Management:** Managed, Supervised, Coordinated, Directed, Oversaw, Led\n    *   **Technical:** Developed, Implemented, Designed, Created, Engineered, Programmed\n    *   **Communication:** Communicated, Presented, Wrote, Edited, Facilitated, Trained\n    *   **Problem Solving:** Solved, Resolved, Analyzed, Identified, Diagnosed, Improved\n    *   **Results-Oriented:** Increased, Reduced, Improved, Achieved, Exceeded, Enhanced\n*   **Quantify Your Accomplishments:**  Whenever possible, quantify your accomplishments with numbers and metrics.  For example, instead of saying \"Improved customer satisfaction,\" say \"Improved customer satisfaction by 15%.\"\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can create a compelling resume that highlights your skills and experience and helps you stand out from the competition. Good luck!\n",
